# Demonstration Branch Strategy

This guide explains the branch structure that supports advanced Laravel content creation. Each branch demonstrates
specific enterprise-level techniques with quantified results, providing working implementations for senior developers
facing production challenges.

## Branch Architecture Philosophy

This repository uses branches as **permanent demonstration platforms** rather than traditional feature development. Each
branch provides:

- **Working implementations** of advanced Laravel patterns
- **Quantified performance data** supporting technical claims
- **Production-ready code** suitable for enterprise environments
- **Systematic methodologies** enabling independent problem-solving

## Branch Usage Workflow

### Content Creation Process

```bash
# Establish performance baseline (when branch exists)
git checkout demo/performance/baseline
./bin/stack up performance -d
# Run baseline measurements

# Implement optimization technique (when branch exists)
git checkout demo/performance/query-optimized  
./bin/stack restart performance
# Run comparative performance tests

# Validate improvements with statistical significance
# Export performance data for content creation
```
